 Sometimes, I would live stream my playing games on Bilibili. Feel free to subscribe at my [living site](https://live.bilibili.com/22584735?visit_id=8qrvtfumaoow)😲 and spam your gift🤖. 

 My streaming starting time could vary from 20:00 pm to 2:00 am (GMT+8). Each live could last 1\~2 hour. 

 Note: I would stay completely silent🤐 because the microphone broke once time. So please enjoy the game🤔.

 In most cases, I would play games available on PC steam, which includes but not limited to
