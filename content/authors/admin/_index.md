Hi there! I'm currently a research assistant at Shanghaitech University and a graduate candidate at Upenn

My research interests include **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics** and **Deep learning**. 

Besides these research topic, I also interest in playing video games and making my own. Sometimes, I would live stream my playing games on Bilibili. Feel free to subscribe at my [living site](https://live.bilibili.com/22584735?visit_id=8qrvtfumaoow). Check my **stream** tab for more info.

Currently, I am taking Zoom courses from Upenn and being a Research Assistant at ShanghaiTech. Supervised by Professor [Xiaopei Liu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/liuxp/), I am focusing on learning-based fluid simulation.
