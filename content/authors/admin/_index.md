Hi there! I'm currently a graduate candidate at Upenn.

My research interests include **Computer Vision(deep learning stuff)**, **Computer Graphics(Physical simulation)**.

Besides these research topic, I also interest in playing video games and making my own. 
<!-- Sometimes, I would live stream my playing games on Bilibili. Feel free to subscribe at my [living site](https://live.bilibili.com/22584735?visit_id=8qrvtfumaoow). Check my **stream** tab for more info. -->
